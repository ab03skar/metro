Ticketing System Mobile App for Riyadh Metro, instead of buying tickets traditionally, we provide a new modern solution which is a mobile application that integrates the ticketing systems of the Riyadh metro to the customerâ€™s mobile to avoid the inconsistent waiting time that may occur before riding the train, the customer could a buy ticket before arriving to the station, Our project focused on UI/UX design and aimed to improve the user experience of the Riyadh Metro Ticketing System. The app allows users to view real-time station congestion, manage their accounts and stations, and provide feedback in real-time. The app is user-friendly and easy to use.
